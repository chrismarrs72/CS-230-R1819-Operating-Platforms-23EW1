_Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?_  
<br>
The client, The Gaming Room, has requested a web-based version of their gaming app.  
Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. 
The game app will have the ability to have one or more teams involved. Each team will have multiple players assigned to it. Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name. Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.  
<br>
_What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?_  
<br>
Without developing a complete architecture for this exercise, I was able to provide enough architecture to specify elements that with the listed requirements, pointed to a cloud-based solution as being the best for this game product.  
<br>
_What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?_  
<br>
The vision of the product and the roadmap for its development became clearer as more detail was added to the template.  As a result, the document would also be usable for explaining the project to those not directly involved in the project at the time of inception.  
<br>
_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_  
<br>
I would have added the cloud-based platforms to the discussion earlier, as the solution became apparent about mid-way through the document creation.  
<br>
_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_  
<br>
The product requirements are deconstructed into features which gives a good view of what is needed to be developed.  This also gives the guidelines during the entire development process to ensure that the code results match the expectations.  
<br>
_How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?_  
<br>
In my process, I look at the initial feature list, the expected output or action, and the data involved to start my analysis.  I have found that if I have these, the design and development plan tends to come fairly easy from this analysis.  I have also found that if I don’t have all of these well defined by the customer or in conjunction with the customer, the project takes a lot longer and the results are mixed.
